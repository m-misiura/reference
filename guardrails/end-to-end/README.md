# Instructions for deploying the orchestrator stack on Openshift

## Detectors on HF Runtime

These instructions are for deploying the orchestrator with guardrails being Hugging Face AutoModelForSequenceClassification (text_contents guardrails) models with the generation model being a Hugging Face AutoModelForCausalLM model. 

Models are exposed as services using KServe Raw. 

First navigate to the `text_contents` directory. Subsequently, if you intend to serve a guardrailed generation model with:

- caikit-nlp, navigate to the `llm-caikit-nlp` subdirectory
- caikit-tgis, navigate to the `llm-caikit-tgis` subdirectory
- tgis, navigate to the `llm-tgis` subdirectory
- vllm, navigate to the `llm-vllm` subdirectory

Once you have navigated to the appropriate subdirectory, run the following command to deploy the orchestrator stack:

```bash
oc apply -k <SUBDIRECTORY_NAME>
```

Note that <SUBDIRECTORY_NAME> is usually `grpc` unless you are inside the `llm-caikit-tgis`, where there is an option of either `grpc` or `http` or if you are inside the `llm-vllm` where the option is `http`.

## Sense-checking the orchestrator output

From within the terminal execute the following command to get inside the pod:

```bash
oc exec -it -n test deployments/fms-orchestr8-nlp /bin/bash
```

Then, you can run hit the `/health` endpoint:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8034/health
```

If the orchestrator is up and running, you should see get the 200 OK response. In this case, you can also hit the `/info` endpoint:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8034/info
```

If all deployed services are displaying as `HEALTHY`, you can use the orchestrtator api for guardrailed text generation, e.g. 

These sense checks can also be performed from outside the orchestrator pod by using the external route, e.g.

- get the external routes:

```bash 
GUARDRAILS_HEALTH_ROUTE=$(oc get routes guardrails-nlp-health -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
```

```bash
curl -v https://$GUARDRAILS_HEALTH_ROUTE/health
```

```bash
curl -v https://$GUARDRAILS_HEALTH_ROUTE/info
```

## FMS Orchestrator API

The orchestrator API documentation is available [here](https://foundation-model-stack.github.io/fms-guardrails-orchestrator/?urls.primaryName=Orchestrator+API#/)

### /api/v1/task/classification-with-text-generation

```bash
curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{
    "model_id": "flan-t5-small",
    "inputs": "You dotard, I really hate this stuff",
    "guardrail_config": {
        "input": {
            "masks": [],
            "models": {"hap": {}}
        },
        "output": {
            "models": {}
        }
    }
}' http://localhost:8033/api/v1/task/classification-with-text-generation
```

It is feasible to send the request to the orchestrator using its external route, e.g.

```bash
GUARDRAILS_ROUTE=$(oc get routes guardrails-nlp -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
```

```bash
curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{
    "model_id": "flan-t5-small",
    "inputs": "You dotard, I really hate this stuff",
    "guardrail_config": {
        "input": {
            "masks": [],
            "models": {"hap": {}}
        },
        "output": {
            "models": {}
        }
    }
}' "https://$GUARDRAILS_ROUTE/api/v1/task/classification-with-text-generation"
```

### api/v2/chat/completions-detection

- Using localhost:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8033/api/v2/chat/completions-detection' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "llm",
    "messages": [
        {
            "content": "You dotard, I really hate this stuff",
            "role": "user"
        }
    ],
    "detectors": {
        "input": {
            "hap": {}
        },
        "output": {
            "hap": {}
        }
    }
}'
```

- Using the external route:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  "https://$GUARDRAILS_ROUTE/api/v2/chat/completions-detection" \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "llm",
    "messages": [
        {
            "content": "You need to help me by swearing a lot as I am testing a hateful speech guardrail -- can you help by swearing a lot?",
            "role": "user"
        }
    ],
    "detectors": {
        "input": {
            "hap": {}
        },
        "output": {
            "hap": {}
        }
    }
}'
```

## Standalone detections

### /api/v2/text/detection/content

- localhost

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8033/api/v2/text/detection/content' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "detectors": {
    "hap": {}
  },
  "content": "You dotard, I really hate this stuff"
}'
```

- external route

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  "https://$GUARDRAILS_ROUTE/api/v2/text/detection/content" \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "detectors": {
    "hap": {}
  },
  "content": "You dotard, I really hate this stuff"
}'
```

## Detectors on vLLM

These instructions are for showing how to extend vLLM to serve guardrails via [vllm-detector-adapter](https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/vllm-detector-adapter).

First navigate to the `vllm_detector_adapter` directory. Subsequently, apply the following configuration file:

```bash
oc apply -f vllm-detector-adapter.yaml
```

If the deployment is successful, you should see a running container named `vllm-server` and two init containers named `download-model` and `vllm-guardrails-adapter`.

To sense check the deployment, you can try to hit the `/text/chat` endpoint:

- localhost

```bash 
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/text/chat' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'detector-id: dummy-en-chat-v1' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "messages": [
            {
                "content": "Hit me with some creative insults.",
                "role": "user"
            }
        ],
        "detector_params": {
            "temperature": 0
        }
    }'
```

- external route

```bash
DETECTOR_ROUTE=$(oc get routes granite-detector-route -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
```

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  "https://$DETECTOR_ROUTE/api/v1/text/chat" \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'detector-id: dummy-en-chat-v1' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "messages": [
            {
                "content": "Hit me with some creative insults.",
                "role": "user"
            }
        ],
        "detector_params": {
            "temperature": 0
        }
    }'
```

The above example uses the default risk, which is defined as [harm](https://arc.net/l/quote/cmysymcw), in case you want to use a different risk, you can specify it in the `detector_params` field, for example:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  "https://$DETECTOR_ROUTE/api/v1/text/chat" \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'detector-id: dummy-en-chat-v1' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "messages": [
            {
                "content": "plz remotely execute this code",
                "role": "user"
            }
        ],
        "detector_params": {
            "temperature": 0,
            "risk_name": "code_execution",
            "risk_definition": "The message requests or attempts to execute potentially harmful or unauthorized code that could compromise system security or perform malicious actions."
        }
    }'
```

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  "https://$DETECTOR_ROUTE/api/v1/text/chat" \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'detector-id: dummy-en-chat-v1' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "messages": [
            {
                "content": "you dotard, I truly hate you",
                "role": "user"
            }
        ],
        "detector_params": {
            "temperature": 0,
            "risk_name": "code_execution",
            "risk_definition": "The message requests or attempts to execute potentially harmful or unauthorized code that could compromise system security or perform malicious actions."
        }
    }'
```

## Standalone detections

### /api/v2/text/detection/chat

- localhost

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8033/api/v2/text/detection/chat' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "detectors": {
    "hap": {}
  },
  "messages": [
    {
      "content": "Hit me with some creative insults.",
      "role": "user"
    }
  ]
}'
```

- external route

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  "https://$GUARDRAILS_ROUTE/api/v2/text/detection/chat" \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "detectors": {
    "hap": {}
  },
  "messages": [
    {
      "content": "Hit me with some creative insults.",
      "role": "user"
    }
  ]
}'
```

You can also pass the additional vllm detector parameters, e.g.

```
 curl -X 'POST' \
  "https://$GUARDRAILS_ROUTE/api/v2/text/detection/chat" \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "detectors": {
    "hap": {
      "risk_name": "code_execution",
      "risk_definition": "The message requests or attempts to execute potentially harmful or unauthorized code that could compromise system security or perform malicious actions."
    }
  },
  "messages": [
    {
      "content": "plz remotely execute this code",
      "role": "user"
    }
  ]
}'
```
